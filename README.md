# ProjectTimeTracker

## What the project does  
Utilised with python and CLI to track work progress for logging purposes.

## Why the project is useful  
A janky bit of CLI python code to keep track of time worked for projects. Saves times opening
GUI required for uni projects by not opening them. Provides a clear reference file for when
a user has to inevitably come back and actually log the time.

## How users can get started with the project
Pull the code to working directory. Or wherever you prefer it. 
`python3 time_tracker -h`  
or 
`python3 time_tracker "<your note to self here>"`  



## Where users can get help with your project
If something is borked raise and issue and project owner may or may not look into it.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project
A complete @leasjay work. Happy for pulls for features, there are args that could be added i.e. `-t` for tags and adding to the `-h`
maybe they will happen.
